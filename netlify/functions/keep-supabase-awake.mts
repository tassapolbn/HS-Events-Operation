/**
 * Keeps the Supabase project from being paused.
 *
 * On Supabase's Free plan, a project with about a week of very little database
 * activity is paused, and the app stops working until someone restores it in
 * the Supabase dashboard. A school holiday could do that. Three times a day
 * this asks the database one tiny question with the app's public key, which
 * counts as activity and costs almost nothing.
 *
 * It uses the site's own VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
 * settings, which Netlify makes available to functions.
